# Introduction

The design and fabrication of a 2.4GHz microstrip patch antenna was one of the significant projects undertaken during my training period at ACCIMT. Microstrip patch antennas have gained considerable attention in modern wireless communication systems due to their low profile, lightweight nature, ease of integration, and cost-effectiveness. These antennas are extensively used in various applications including Wi-Fi devices and wireless routers (2.4GHz ISM band), IoT (Internet of Things) devices, Military radar systems, and Medical devices.

## Challenge

The challenge of this project lay in designing and implementing a functional patch antenna without access to specialized fabrication equipment. Working as a team of two, we approached this through careful theoretical calculations, simulation using electromagnetic software, and innovative fabrication techniques using readily available materials. Despite the limitations in resources, we successfully designed, fabricated, and tested a working prototype that achieved satisfactory performance at the target frequency of 2.4GHz.

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in:
- Practical application of microwave engineering principles
- Understanding of antenna parameters and their optimization
- Implementation of cost-effective fabrication techniques
- Testing and measurement using a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA)
- Problem-solving in resource-constrained environments and team collaboration

We have published all the design files, including the footprints and results, in a GitHub repo: [GitHub Link](https://github.com/Git-Kavinda/2.4GHz_Patch_Antenna_Design).
